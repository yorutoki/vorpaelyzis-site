# General Terms

 1. Services and commissioned offers are of Digital Goods kind and as
    such, there will be no items shipped.
 2. Vorpaelyzis reserves the right to refuse any commission request.
 3. The timeline for the commission begins only once the client has been notified of their turn.
 4. Vorpaelyzis is allowed to work on personal art, take breaks while having active orders.
 5. By default, all art commissioned for Personal Use only. Commercial rights can be purchased on top of it any time the customer wishes to, but they will have to discuss privately .
 6. Full privacy may incur additional fees and must be notified by the client prior to any payment.
 7. Vorpaelyzis reserves the right to cancel any order if there is strong animosity between the artist and the client.
 8. Client, upon cancelling an order after sketching phase, is NOT allowed to use Vorpaelyzis' sketch to give to another artist to continue or inspire in any capacity.
 9. Upon payment, the client is expected to keep Vorpaelyzis informed of any update of their contact information. If all information provided becomes unusable before the start of the order and the client can no longer be reached, the commission will be canceled after 10 business days. The client will no longer be eligible for a refund.
 10. Prices are final and non-negotiable (unless offered by Vorpaelyzis). Any attempt to negotiate pricing will result in Vorpaelyzis declining the request.
 11. Using commissioned products in any blockchain-related technology, such as (but not limited to) NFTs and cryptocurrency, is **strictly prohibited**.
 12. Using commissioned products in any AI-training capacity, such as (but not limited to) usage in Stable Diffusion models,Grok, ChatGPT, Sora AI etc., is **strictly prohibited**. This applies to Past, Present and Future commissions.

## Art Specific
### Artstyle
The quality of the product may differ from the quality of any previous artworks that are used only as an art style reference. All artworks are made uniquely from scratch, and as such, should not be expected to retain absolute closeness to one another, but an effort will be made to retain similarity to the requested overall artstyle.

### Coloring
The client understands that within all colored commissions the character references are provided as a color guide, not as a rule. The coloring of requested characters may differ in the final product due to such factors as environment, lighting, effects, or artstyle.
(Example: Cold blue tones may look purple under warm lighting)

### Artistic Liberty
Upon offering artistic liberty for any aspect of the commissioned art (such as pose, clothing, lighting, background, props etc.), the client waives their right to refund for not having their requirements met (in regard to aspects provided with artistic liberty), and agrees to any incurring fees for changes, should they decide to request any (in regard to aspects provided with artistic liberty).

## Copyright & Usage

 1. The client does not have the right to repurpose, redistribute or edit any of the commissioned products. (Unless discussed with and permitted by Vorpaelyzis)
 2. The client does not have the right to claim the commission as their own work.
 3. All rights to the image remain with vorpaelyzis, the artist,
    including its distribution and use. Vorpaelyzis retains the right to
    post the images publicly on any platform they see fit, including but
    not limited to, their social media accounts and portfolio.
 4. The client is encouraged to credit Vorpaelyzis by screen name
    (vorpaelyzis), Twitter handle ([@vorpaelyzis](https://x.com/vorpaelyzis)) and Tumblr
    ([@vorpaelyzis](https://www.tumblr.com/vorpaelyzis)) on any platform where the commission is displayed
    publicly.

# Payment, Discounts & Refunds
**Payment will be done via Paypal Invoice. Kofi is acceptable only when the customer does not have access to the previously mentioned service.** 

Due to the nature of Kofi, I will be adding a small fee to make up for the fee taken by the site. 

## Payments & Fees

 1. Full Upfront payment is not negotiable when the final price is less
    than 150USD. Only if the agreed price exceeds 150USD then the client
    would be eligible to ask for a payment plan. To add to the term
    above, Vorpaelyzis will not be providing full work until the invoice
    is paid in full. Only a sketch and up to 45-50% of the work will be
    done and shown to the customer.
 2. As stated above, for 150USD+ orders I require at least a 50% non
    refundable down payment upfront unless otherwise discussed. Once
    that is received, I will start on the commission.
 3. Fees may apply depending on complexity of the request, design,
    ★unclear references — as well as edits requested after the sketch
    has been approved, depending on its size. Bigger orders will be able
    to request a few minor changes during coloring / painting before
    fees being charged (2-3USD each)
 
<div class="note">★ Unclear references refer to: Mood Boards, Pinterest Boards, and
    things of similar nature. Amount of fees depending on the size,
    type, and complexity of the design itself and the order
    (chibi, icon, sketches, flats+lines, or illustration)</div>

4. No refunds are possible after the work is done, approved and received by the client.

## Delivery Options
By default, commissions with no deadline or rushed request can take from 2 weeks to 3 months to complete, based on the scale and complexity of the commissioned product. Vorpaelyzis will always be reachable and update the client on the progress of the work, as well as any delays that may incur during the commission. After ordering, Vorpaelyzis will be giving an estimate of time/day when it'd be done by.

 1. Delivery may be delayed by other concurrent orders with a
    deadline/rushed priority. Any delay affecting a commission will be
    notified to the client.
 2. The client can request a deadline for their commission. If the
    project is accepted, a +25% to +35% fee per item will be applied to
    the order, based on workload, timeframe and complexity of the
    project. Deadline orders must be paid in full upfront. (15+ days
    from when ordered only)
 3. The client can request a rush delivery for their commission. If the
    project is accepted, a +85% fee per item will be applied to the
    order. Delivery is guaranteed within 5-10 days upon receipt of
    payment.
 4. The client can request an express delivery for their commission. If
    the project is accepted, a +180% fee per item will be applied to the
    order. Delivery is guaranteed within 1-2 days upon receipt of
    payment.

## Cancellations, Refunds & Chargebacks

 1. Administrative fees are excluded from all refunds.
 2. The client is eligible for a full refund if the commission is
    canceled prior to the start of the project.
 3. The client is no longer eligible for a full refund if they choose to
    cancel a commission after the project has been started.
 4. However, the client may be eligible for a partial refund upon
    cancellation of the project, depending on the stage of the
    commission work. The refund amount is ultimately decided by
    Vorpaelyzis, but it is generally based on the stage of the project
    at the moment of cancellation.
 5. Once the commission work has been fully completed according to the
    directions of the client, and approved by them, they are no longer
    eligible for any refunds.
 6. If Vorpaelyzis fails to meet a deadline or any other requirement
    requested in the initial agreement, the client will be eligible for
    a refund.
 7. Chargebacks are strictly prohibited.
 8. Repeatedly canceling commissions will result in immediate
    blacklisting.
 9. Purposeful chargebacks with no prior notifications to Vorpaelyzis
    will result in immediate blacklisting including public display of:
    e-mail address, Social media handles.
