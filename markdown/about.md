### 22 | any pronouns | artist

hello! you can call me **vorpae** or vorpy. I'm a digital artist and illustrator, it is my main source of income. I enjoy studying artstyles whether it be old masters or not.

Other than commission works, I mostly draw my original characters & worlds. I enjoy reading & painting on streams in rare occasions. I also dabble in writing and roleplays when I can in private.
